1. What is a class? According to the book, what does a class “arrange?”
    + It is a classification of "thing: when you "arrange" you systematically arrange information and behavior into a meaningful entity.  
2. What are the two purposes of encapsulation?
    + to combine methods and data within a class (support classification)
    + to control the accessibility of the methods and data (control the use of the class)
3. How do you instantiate an instance of a class? How do you access that instance?
<<<<<<< HEAD
    + use (new) keyword to create. you use a object specifying the class as its type. By using the variable.

4. What is the default access of the ﬁelds and methods of a class? How do you change the default?
    + The default of the class is private, to use public to change. 
5. What is the syntax for writing a constructor?
    + Public or Private the named constructor() {return} it cannot return a value but must be public can be used to initializes a variable that may be in the method of a class and used outside the class.
6. What is the diﬀerence between class ﬁelds and methods, and instance ﬁelds ad methods? How do you create class ﬁelds and methods? 
    + You access class fields and methods using the class name, you access the object(instance) fields and methods by calling the object name.  
7. How do you bring a static class in scope? Why would you want to bring a static class in scope?
<<<<<<< HEAD
    + Static(you can not instatziate objects of that class) by utilizing a using statement (Using static system. Math) so you can, you write less code.
8. Can you think of a good reason to create an anonymous class? What is it?
    + A class that does not have a name,( you dont have to think of a name) A class you want to use once

9. What is polymorphism as this term is used in computer science? This is not in the book.
    + being able to assign different meanings to methods and functions based on type.
10. What is message passing as this term is used in computer science? This is not in the book.
    + a technique for invoking behavior not concerning how it is done. communication between processes.
11. What was the ﬁrst object-oriented programming language?
    + simula

12. Consider this quote by Alexander Stepanov: I ﬁnd OOP technically unsound. It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebras — families of interfaces that span multiple types. I ﬁnd OOP philosophically unsound. It claims that everything is an object. Even if it is true it is not very interesting — saying that everything is an object is saying nothing at all. Who is Alexander Stephanov? What do you think about this quote
    + Russian computer programmer, best known as an advocate of generic programming and as the primary designer and implementer of the C++ Standard Template Library. I think he is correct but the term object is a relative term and is based off perspective. It is based in a mutlisorted algebra but is done based on object type.
