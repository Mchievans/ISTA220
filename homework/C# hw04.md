1. What are all possible values of a Boolean expression?
    + True, False
  
1. List eight Boolean operators.
    + <
    + (>)
    + <=
    + (>=)
    + ==
    + !=
    + &&
    + ||
  
1. What is the general concept of short circuiting? This question has a short and simple answer and you do not need to have a detailed response.

   + if the expression is evaluated and one of the expressions in logical AND or a logical OR operator is evaluated to be either true or false when only one expression needs to be correct then the statement will for the entire statement to be

1. What are the difference in how short circuiting works for && and ||?
    + If false in && statement then it is false, if || statement if true then entire statement true.

1. Look at the list of operators. What operator has the highest precedence? Which has the lowest?
    + the parenthesis () has the highest precedence.
    + the assignment = has the lowest.

1. In an if or else construction using multiple lines of code, what effect does the use of curly braces have?
    + it signifies a block, it groups Boolean statements acts as a delimiter. Always use curly braces

1. In a switch statement, what happens if you omit break?
    + the case will fall through to the next statement.

1. What is a recursive method? Using a language, you know (such as English), write a recursive method that adds up the integers in a list of integers. The input to the method is a list of integers and the output is a scalar value representing a sum.
    + Its a method that calls its self. 
    + The recursive method recurs with he parameters integer a and integer b. the sum of the parameter equals b. If I evaluate an expression for a variable equaling one and I have a return value for the b plus one each time then it will reoccur until a is greater that b.
