1. What is a compound assignment operator? How does it work?
<<<<<<< HEAD
    + it is an assignment operator combined with an arthmetic operator. It is a short hand version of assigning computing and assigning a value.

2. List all the compound assignment operators.
    + *=
    + /=
    + %=
    + +=
    + -=

3. List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50.
  + Variable += 5;
  + Variable = Variable + 5
  + Variable -= 50
  + Variable = Variable - 50

4. How long does a while loop run?
    + Until the Boolean expression evaluates false.
5. What happens if you donâ€™t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?
    + It will evaluate forever. 
6. How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any of them? Can you omit all of them? What happens if you omit all of them?
<<<<<<< HEAD
    + four parts (intilization, boolean expression, update contol variable) statement
    + yes, even the boolean expression, nothing is evauluated and it will run forver.
7. How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?
    + use a do while loop, the boolean expression is evaluated at the end. 
8. What does the break statement do?
    + eixt a iteration loop
9. What does the continue statement do?
    + causes the program to run the next iteration of the loop imediately. 
=======
    + four parts (initialization, Boolean expression, update control variable) statement
    + yes, even the Boolean expression, nothing is evaluated and it will run forever.
7. How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?
    + use a do while loop, the Boolean expression is evaluated at the end. 
8. What does the break statement do?
    + exit a iteration loop
9. What does the continue statement do?
    + causes the program to run the next iteration of the loop immediately.
