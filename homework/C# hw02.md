1. A local variable is a variable that exist only in a method or another small section of code.

2.	A statement is a command that performs an action.

4.	A variable is a storage location that holds a value.

5.	A method is an named sequence of statements encapsulate a behavior.

6.	Primitive types and value types are the same. 

7.	Arithmetic operators are used to compute variable types and are dependent on the types. Only the plus operator can be used of reference types.

8.	The .ToString() method.

9.	The Int32.Parse() Method.

10.	Precedence governs the order operators are evaluated while associativity is the direction in which the operators are evaluated ignoring the precedence.  This would make a difference in the equation 2+2/2. If done by precedence it 
equals 3, if done by associativity left to right it equals 2.

11.	You must assign a variable a value in C#.

12.	They are not evaluated differently and are computed the same however the point at which it is evaluated is different. 

13.	interpolated expression items being replaced with the properly formatted string representations of their result. You can put variable names in a string, and it replace the variable. 

14.	The var keyword instructs the computer to guess the variable type.
